<li>UpLTV provides better ad fill rate and higher exhibition price ( eCPM ) than a single platform by integrating multiple ad resources. Usually, it will boost your monetization by 20 percent.</li>

<li>UPLTV has better loading strategies, traffic distribution and scheduling logic.</li>
<li>The goal of UPLTV is to optimize the life cycle value (LTV). It takes the short-term and long-term monetization into consideration and balances the monetization and retention.</li>
<li>UPLTV has a better back-end AI data analysis system and provides more room for improvement.</li>
<li>We believe that monetization should be an ongoing MaaS (Monetization as a Service) instead of a simple SDK docking. We also value the logic of providing the best advertising based on the customerâs game content, which is more dependent on the combination of deep machine learning and manual intervention.

<ul class="simple">
<li>We do not recommend re-integration among UPSDK and other third-party ad platforms, which may reduce revenue (repetitive ads).</li>

</ul>
<p>Our recommendation is to take over the provisioning strategy directly from the UPSDK in the top-level logic .</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the decline in revenue due to our SDK, we can provide the corresponding claims protection clause in the contract.</p>

<ol class="simple">
<li>UpLTV has integrated the data API for every third-party advertising platform, so that it can access to the product information such as the sub-national rate, click-through rate per hour filling rate etc..</li>
<li>Then the more efficient advertising platform will come first through comprehensive calculations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, real-time bidding is not mainstream in the industry for mobile In-App advertising . We are still using a strategy-based collation.</p>
<p>But it is worth mentioning what we have done.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The data provided by the advertising platform will be revised according to our own statistics.</li>
<li>Full consideration is given to the impact of the ranking itself on prices and CTR, which is corrected by the model.</li>
<li>Add additional scheduling strategies to capture short-term opportunities for short-term premium offers in some regions.</li>

<p>However, in order to support the A/B Testing function of the advertisement , we may need to pass the information of âwhether it is a paid userâ or âwhether it has passed the novice tutorialâ to the game developer to help us optimize. Specific information has different options depending on the game.</p>
<p>In fact, we provide three levels of access services based on customer needs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SDK - integrated into the game concurrent version, relatively junior docking, suitable for small CP, customers who have little or no experience in advertising cash.</li>
<li>API - Need to pass a small amount of data through the interface (whether it is a paid user), large and medium-sized CP, full awareness of advertising.</li>
<li>AI - Need to pass more in-game events through the interface (clearance, failure, resurrection, new records, etc.), deep cooperation customers, fully aware of the value of advertising cash.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above are SDK-based and do not require a CP open data platform.</p>

However, in order to improve the LTV, we will not provide the function of limiting eCPM .

<p>There are three main dimensions of UPLTVâs attention:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Willingness to pay</li>
<li>Retention viscosity</li>
<li>Active advertising</li>
</ul>
<p>Our AI system will roughly group the high, medium and low groups based on the above three dimensions based on the userâs events in the game. Then it will provide personalized advertising display strategies based on groupings.</p>
