## Rewarded Video Ad

### Ads Object Initialization 

Initialize Rewarded Video like this:

    mVideoAd = UPRewardVideoAd.getInstance(this);

### Show Rewarded Video Ads

When you want show Rewarded Video ads, call `isReady` to check if the video was ready. You can determine your "play" button display status with the return value of `isReady`.
Then, you should call `show` method to display video ads.
Please use the correct value of parameter `Placement ID` for different ads placement.

**Don't forget to call `isReady` before `show` to make sure there is a video available.**

> You can set the parameter `Placement ID` to any significative name you want. If you're not sure, please discuss with our **support engineer**. You should use a different `Placement ID` for different ads placement. We provide revenue from each  `Placement ID` in the feature.
> Eg: You may use "Pause" or "Menu" when initializing our SDK in the pause scene of your game.

    if (mVideoAd != null && mVideoAd.isReady()) {
        mVideoAd.show("Ad Placement");
    }

### Callback

You can use the interface `setUPVideoAdListener` to setup callback functions.
For the most part, you only need to care about the method `onVideoAdReward` and `onVideoAdDontReward`, which can tell you if you should give the user a reward or not.

    mVideoAd.setUPVideoAdListener(new UPRewardVideoAdListener() {
        @Override
        public void onVideoAdClicked() {
            // click callback
        }

        @Override
        public void onVideoAdClosed() {
            // close callback
        }

        @Override
        public void onVideoAdDisplayed() {
            // impression callback
        }

        @Override
        public void onVideoAdReward() {
            // reward callback, means user already reached the reward condition
        }

        @Override
        public void onVideoAdDontReward(String reason) {
            // DON'T reward callback, means user hasn't reached the reward condition, like too short time to view video.
        }
    });

### Debug Page

We provide a debug page to assist your integration works. You can easily access all status of video ads during development process with the following code:

    if (mVideoAd != null) {
        mVideoAd.showVideoDebugActivity(this);
    }


The page looks like this. Columns (left to right):
- Affiliate name
- Is this Affiliate SDK integrated?
- Is this Affiliate opened by server side configuration?
- Did this Affiliate Ads successfully load?

You can play ads by clicking the item if the ads successfully loaded.
