## Initial SDK

Only used Xcode engineering  as an example for explanation. If you are using other projects, please refer to Xcode engineering operation. Sorry for any inconvenience.

The UPLTV SDK is very simple to initialize.

### Add the following reference to your project
Add `UPLTV.js` and `UPLTVIos.js` to the `src->upltv` directory and then set them into the `project.json` file.

```javascript
"jsList" : [
        "src/resource.js",
        "src/app.js",
        "src/upltv/UPLTV.js",
        "src/upltv/UPLTVIos.js"
]
```
### Initial UPSDK

```javascript
/**
* Please be sure to complete the SDK initialization before using the other API interfaces of the SDK
* @param zone product distribution area, 0 overseas, 1 mainland China
*/
intSdk : function(zone, callback)

```

Sampleï¼š
```javascript
var initSdkButton = this.createButton(x, y, "initSdk");
initSdkButton.addTouchEventListener(function(sender, type) {
    if (type == 2) {
        upltv.intSdk(0);
    }
}, this);
```
####  setCustomerId()

Only for Android and games that released in China,you must set androidid to ensure the correct statistics.

```asp

// Please call this method before intializating
// Version 3004(subversion 5) and above support this method
// @param androidid

upltv.setCustomerId(androidid)
```

###  Add onApplicationFocus()
For the Android platform, we strongly recommend calling the following two interfaces of UPSDK when switching between the front and back of the game, so that UPSDK can respond correctly.

#### Call the method when the game in  the foreground
```java
UPAdsSdk.onApplicationResume();
```
#### Call the method when the game is in the background
```java
UPAdsSdk.onApplicationPause();
```

Sample:

Usually the game activity generated by the Cocos2d-X engine inherits from org.cocos2dx.lib.Cocos2dxActivity. In the Demo project, this class is AppActivity.

```java
    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        UPAdsSdk.onApplicationResume();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        UPAdsSdk.onApplicationPause();
    }
```
