## Eclipse

### I.Structure of UPSDK CppPlugin 

For projects built with Eclipse, UPSDK is imported into the project as `*.jar`. Download UPSDK JavaScriptPlugin in ( [Android-LayaboxJsSDK](http://doc.upltv.com/en/master/chapters/chapter09.html "download"))and unzip：

- `Eclipse`
   This directory mainly contains the ad dependency library files required for Eclipse project access.
- `js`
	This directory mainly contains some *.js source files for bridging the current `Layabox Js` project with the UPSDK interface call.
- `Android Studio`
    If you build project through,please ignore this directory.
- `proguard-project.txt`
	The configuration file of confusion,if you need to obfuscate code, add the contents of this file to the file that the project depends on.
	
### II.Import UPSDK main package

#### 1.Add files of UPSDK
Take UPSDK v3.0.05 as an example. In the `upsdk_ads` directory, there are three directories: `libs`, `res` and `assets`. Please copy the contents of the directory to the corresponding directory of your Eclipse main project ( If there is no libs directory, create a libs directory with the same level as src in the app folder).

As follows:

> `UPAdsSdk_LayaJs_3.0.05.jar`just for reference

#### 2.Check minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion in `Manifest`
UPSDK requires that minSdkVersion cannot be lower than 15, and targetSdkVersion cannot be higher than 26, so check it in the `build.gradle` file，as follows：
```groovy
 < uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="16" android:targetSdkVersion="24" />
```
#### 3.Make sure *.so files are aligned
There are 3 types of .so files of the cpu type in folder name `libs`：
- armeabi
- armeabi-v7a
- x86

According to your needs, just delete the unwanted CPU architecture in the libs directory.

### III.Add ad networdks
#### 1.Add Google Ads SDK

Please refer to**Add files of UPSDK** to add Google Ads into your porject,as follows：

![ec-3-1](http://docc.upltv.com/uploads/201809/5b98f679af237_5b98f679.png "ec-3-1")
> In particular, if your project already has a different version of google play service, use the higher version.


#### 2.Add other networdks
To ensure you get more revenue, add as many ad libraries as possible to your project.
Folder named `optional_ads` contents  network dependencies file that exists in the form of `*.jar`. Please refer to **Add files of UPSDK** to add it to your project, and copy the contents of the AndroidManifest file to your project's Manifest file.


### IV. Add Android Support library 

The display of the ad requires the support of the `support` library, so please bring it into your project. We have the corresponding `xxx.jar` file for you in the `android_support_library/libs` folder. You just need to added those files into the `libs` directory,as follows：

![ec-4-1](http://docc.upltv.com/uploads/201809/5b98f6edd1b61_5b98f6ed.png)

### V. Modify AndroidManifest.xml file
Please duplicate the content of `AndroidManifest.xml` file into the related location in your project.

### Ⅵ. Add *.js files

#### 1.Add files in project

The UPSDK implements cross-platform calls to the native interface via the *js source file, so all *.js files in `js/src/upltv` must be copied to the project.

1) Copy `upltv` to the `src` folder of the Layabox project, leaving only the `.js` file

2) Add the reference to `UPLTV.js`, `UPLTVIos.js` in index.html which in the bin folder of the Layabox project.

As following:

### Ⅶ.Modify Proguard setting 
If your project used `proguard`.
You have to copy contents from `proguard-project.txt` to right location of your project.
