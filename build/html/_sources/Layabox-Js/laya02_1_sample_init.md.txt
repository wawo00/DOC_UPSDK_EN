## Initial SDK

Only used Xcode engineering  as an example for explanation. If you are using other projects, please refer to Xcode engineering operation. 
The UPLTV SDK is very simple to initialize.

### Initial UPSDK
```javascript
/*
* Please be sure to complete the SDK initialization before using the other API interfaces of the SDK
* @param zone product distribution area, 0 overseas, 1 mainland China, 2 automatically according to IP positioning
*/
intSdk : function(zone, callback)
```

Sample：
```javascript
var initSdkButton = this.createButton(x, y, "initSdk");
initSdkButton.addTouchEventListener(function(sender, type) {
    if (type == 2) {
        upltv.intSdk(0);
    }
}, this);
```
###  setCustomerId()
Only for Android and games that released in China,you must set androidid to ensure the correct statistics.
.
```asp

// Please call this method before intializating
// Version 3004(subversion 5) and above support this method
// @param androidid

upltv.setCustomerId(androidid)
```

###  Add onApplicationFocus()
For the Android platform, we strongly recommend calling the following two interfaces of UPSDK when switching between the front and back of the game, so that UPSDK can respond correctly.

#### Call the method when the game in  the foreground
```java
UPAdsSdk.onApplicationResume();
```
#### Call the method when the game is in the background
```java
UPAdsSdk.onApplicationPause();
```
