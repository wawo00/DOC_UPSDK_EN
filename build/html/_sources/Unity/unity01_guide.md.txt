## UnityPlugin Guide

UPSDK Unity Plugin including UPLTV AD SDK (Android,IOS platform and dependent library), designed for C#, provides native API calls, and implements business functions such as interstitial ad, reward video ad, and banner ad.

Due to the excessive versions of Unity , we have support for the following versions of the following platforms:
1. Android,only support Unity 5.0.0 and following version
2. Ios,only support Unity 5.1.0 and following version

> If you need to support an earlier version, please contact us.

The UPSDK Unity Plugin contains the support components needed for the android and ios platforms. Considering that the IOS SDK body size is very different from the Android version, three access methods will be provided, please choose the suitable way according to the actual situation.

1. Only Android platform
    
    If your app is only be released for the Android market, only the Android platform plugin is your best choice. The size of the plugin is less than 10M , is very lightweight compared to IOS (540 M).
	
2. Only Ios platform

	If your app is only be released for the Ios market, only the Ios platform plugin is your best choice. Since the plug-in package is large (including the IOS support of UPSDK and the third-party library), please keep the network connection stable when downloading.
	
> As the IOS plugin package is much larger than Android, we will no longer provide a individual IOS plugin package..
	
3. Android and Ios platform

	If your app designed  for both Android and iOS markets, such plugin will be your best choice. This package includes Android and Ios support of UPSDK and corresponding third-party libraries (about 550M, please keep the network work well when downloading),
