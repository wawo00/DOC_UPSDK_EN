### 1. Updating the plugin
If you have integrated UPSDK Unity Plugin before, to make sure the correctness of plugin library after updating, we suggest that please completely delete UPSDK Unity Plugin before the updating.

In your Unity project, please check whether `Assets/PolyADSDK/Plugins/` and `Assets/StreamingAssets/UPSDK_android/` exist. Generally, when you delete `PolyADSDK` and `UPSDK_android` folder(including its subcatalog), the whole import plugin will be completely deleted.

If you have edit the name of `PolyADSDK` catalog or the location of its subcatalog, please find out its corrected location and delete it. Specially, if you added some files after updating `PolyADSDK` and those files need to be retained, please be careful in case deleting them.

Please continue **NEXT STEP**.

### 2. In your project, select Assets, right click and select: Import Package -> Custom Package
