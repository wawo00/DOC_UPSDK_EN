## Access for Android

### I. Declaration
Android Platform, supports Unity 5.0.0 or higher version

### II. Checking Assets Catalog in Unity Project
When Unity plugin for Android finishes to be import, please check whether `PolyADSDK/Plugins/Android` exists under Assets catalog.

- 3.0.02 and lower plugin version
Soon after the successful import, there will be like as below in Assets catalog:
![import](http://docc.upltv.com/uploads/201804/5acc569aeb642_5acc569a.png "工程结构")

#### 1. `libs_res`
This directory includes `AvidlyAdsSdk_2.0.xx_dex.aar`, `support-v4-24.1.1.aar`, and `proguard-project.txt` files.
> 	The support-v4 library must be added. The version of V24.1.1 is the version recommended by the plug-in. If there are other higher-level v4 libraries in the project, you can directly replace the recommended version.

#### 2.`thirdlibs`
`thirdlibs/aar` is the directory used to reference some network library that does not support dynamic loading,such as: appcompat-v7-24.1.1.jar.

#### 3.`avidly_android`
This directory includes many third-party networdk that named like 'dex_xxx.jar' for dynamic loading at runtime.

- 3.0.03 (included) and higher plugin version
Soon after the successful import, there will be like as below in  `Assets` catalog:
![工程结构](http://docc.upltv.com/uploads/201805/5b026a7687a70_5b026a76.jpeg "55333")

In 3.0.03 and higher plugin version, in order to Simplify access steps,we remove`avidly_android` and change `AvidlyAdsSdk_x.x.xx_dex.aar` to `UPAdsSdk_3.0.xx_dex.aar`.

### III. Adaption for Unity specific version
1、 5.1.1, during compile-build-package, unity can not find error for armeabi structure-----it needs to remove armeabi structure in .arr(using unarchiver to open it and delete armeabi folder directly)；

2、5.0.0，during the apk packaging process, merge AndroidManifest.xml jurisdiction losses-----it needs to add AndroidManifest.xml into \Assets\Plugins\Android\
