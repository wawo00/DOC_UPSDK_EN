> `trouble writing output: Too many method references to fit in one dex file: 67449; max is 65536.`

In order to solve this problem, Unity has supported Multidex since 5.5 and is solved by Dex subcontracting.

### 1. [Use Android Studio ](https://doc.upltv.com/en/master/Unity/unity06_2_multidex_dexbyas.html )
In the Android Studio project, it is possible to flexibly complete apk packaging via gradle, provided that Android Studio 2.2.3 or higher is required.

### 2. [Use UnityIDE ](https://doc.upltv.com/en/master/Unity/unity06_3_multidex_dexbyunity.html)
Simply copy the necessary files and initial settings to complete the subcontracting.
