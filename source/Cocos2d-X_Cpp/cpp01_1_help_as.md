## Android Studio 

### I.Structure of UPSDK CppPlugin
Regarding to Android Studio or Gradle built project, UPSDK suggests it should be import by other main project in  *.aar  format. Download UPSDK CppPlugin( [Android-CPPSDK](http://doc.upltv.com/en/master/chapters/chapter09.html "SDKDownLoad") UPSDK CppPlugin)You will see the structure of directory when you unzip it:


![as-1-1](http://docc.upltv.com/uploads/201805/5afd2c552eab2_5afd2c55.png "as-1-1")
>The UPSDK CppPlugin main package is named `UPAdsSdk_Cpp_x.x.xx_dex.aar`.

- `Android Studio`
    This directory mainly contains the ad dependency library files required for Android Studio.
- `cpp`
    This directory mainly contains some *.cpp source files for bridging the current Cocos2d-X cpp project with the UPSDK interface .
- `Eclipse`
    This directory contains some jars and resource files. Please ignore this directory if you use  Android Studio to build apk.
- `proguard-project.txt`
    The configuration file of confusion,if you need to obfuscate code, add the contents of this file to the file that the project depends on.
    

### II.Import UPSDK main package
#### 1.Add files of UPSDK
According to the above introduction, find the file named `UPAdsSdk_Cpp_x.x.xx_dex.aar` in the file directory you downloaded and add it to the `libs` directory of the project (Note: If there is no this directory, try to  create it and in the same directory as src.
After adding, it looks like this:

![as-2-1](http://docc.upltv.com/uploads/201805/5afd2d4e483b6_5afd2d4e.png "as-2-1")
> `UPAdsSdk_Cpp_3.0.03_dex` just only for reference

To ensure that the aar package in the libs directory is correctly referenced by the project, check the `build.gradle` file in the `app` directory to add the following  parameters:

```groovy
repositories {
        flatDir {
             dirs 'libs'
        }
}

```
Finally add aar to the dependencies scope

```groovy
dependencies {
        // Please replace UPAdsSdk_Cpp_3.0.03_dex with the actual file name.
        compile(name: 'UPAdsSdk_Cpp_3.0.03_dex', ext: 'aar')
}
```

#### 2.Check minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion in `build.gradle`
UPSDK requires that minSdkVersion cannot be lower than 15, and targetSdkVersion cannot be higher than 26, so check it in the `build.gradle` file .


Sample：

```groovy
 defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 26
}
```
The Cocos2dx-3.X project will automatically generates the default configuration of PROP_MIN_SDK_VERSION and PROP_TARGET_SDK_VERSION in gradle.properties, you only need to modify the values of both.

Recommended changes are as follows:
```
 PROP_MIN_SDK_VERSION=16
 PROP_TARGET_SDK_VERSION=26
```

#### 3.Make sure *.so files are aligned
There are 3 types of .so files of the cpu type in `UPAdsSdk_Cpp_x.x.xx_dex.aar`：
- armeabi
- armeabi-v7a
- x86

Please add abiFilters configuration to the `gradle.build` file according to the cup type supported by the project ,that can ensure these files are aligned.

If the current project only supports armeabi-v7a, please refer to the following modifications:

```
defaultConfig {
        ndk {
            abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a'
        }
 }
```

>abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a' means this app will be supported in devices which base on armeabi-v7a architecture.

### III.Add ad networdks

#### 1.Add Google Ads SDK

###### 1.**Sample code**
In the `build.gradle` , download the gms play-service16.0.0 package from Google's remote repository via the compile command.Like this:
    
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:16.0.0'
    }


> In particular, if your project already has a different version of google play service, use the higher version.

#### 2.Add other networdks
To ensure you get more revenue, add as many ad libraries as possible to your project.
Please refer to the following method to add the file named `xxx_ads.aar` in `Android Studio/aar` to the project.
###### Global except China
The build.gradle is as follows：
```groovy
dependencies {
    //other ads-libs
    //gson-2.7.jar in folder named android_support_library
    compile(name: 'gson-2.7', ext: 'jar')
    compile(name: 'facebook_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'facebook_exo_player', ext: 'aar')

    compile(name: 'mobvista_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'unity_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'vungle_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'chartboost_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'ironsource_ads', ext: 'aar')
    
    compile(name: 'adcolony_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'applovin_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'playable_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'tapjoy_ads', ext: 'aar')
}
```

###### Only in China

The build.gradle is as follows：
```groovy
dependencies {
    //other ads-libs
    //gson-2.7.jar in folder named android_support_library
    compile(name: 'gson-2.7', ext: 'jar')
    compile(name: 'centrixlink_ads', ext: 'aar')

    compile(name: 'mobvista_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'vungle_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'chartboost_ads', ext: 'aar')
    
    compile(name: 'inmobi_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'oneway_ads', ext: 'aar')
    compile(name: 'playable_ads', ext: 'aar')
}
```

###### Global
Merge the above two files into one file.

### IV.Add Android Support library 
Every affiliate needs `android.support.xxx`, so please import it to your project. If you are using Android Studio in your project, you can modify `build.gradle` file to add

Starting with the 3004 version of UPSDK, we recommend the 26.1.0 version of the Android support library (including v4 and v7) because of the upgrade of Admob and other networks. Of course, in special cases, it is also possible to use a lower one such as v25.3.1 of  Android support library.

#### 1.Import Android Support library

In the `build.gradle` , download the support libraries  from Google's remote repository via the compile command.Like this:

```groovy
dependencies { 
    //core lib
    compile(name: 'UPAdsSdk_Cpp_3.0.04_dex', ext: 'aar')
    //support libs
    compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:26.1.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:26.1.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:26.1.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:26.1.0'
    compile  'com.android.support:customtabs:26.1.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:26.1.0'
}

```

**【Attention】Android Support
 Support libraries must be imported into your project!！**


### V.Add *.cpp files

#### 1.Add files in project
The UPSDK implements cross-platform calls to the native interface via the *cpp source file, so all *.cpp and *.h files in `cpp/upltv` must be copied to the current project.

Cocos2d-x 3.16 version can be copied to the Classes folder. If there are differences in other versions, please refer to the modification. The effect is as follows：
![classes](http://docc.upltv.com/uploads/201804/5acacf5c67cbc_5acacf5c.png "classes")
>This article is based on cocos2dx-3.16. If your directory does not match this, ask our support team for help.

### 2.Modify android.mk in jni directory
Open the android.mk file which in the jni directory of project.
Please copy **UpltvAndroid.cpp，CocosUpLtv.cpp，UpltvBridge.cpp** those files into **LOCAL_SRC_FILES**.
Take Cocos2d-X 3.16 as an example. The addition method is as follows. For other versions, please modify the relative path.:

```groovy
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/hellocpp/main.cpp \
                   $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../../Classes/AppDelegate.cpp \
                   $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../../Classes/HelloWorldScene.cpp \
                   $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../../Classes/upltv/UpltvAndroid.cpp \
                   $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../../Classes/upltv/CocosUpLtv.cpp \
                   $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../../Classes/upltv/UpltvBridge.cpp
```
### Ⅵ.Modify Proguard setting 
If your project used `proguard`.
You have to copy contents from `proguard-project.txt` to right location of your project.

### Ⅶ.Fix up 65535 limitation

If the number of methods exceeds 65535 due to access to the UPSDK and cannot be builded correctly, please use the `MultiDex` . If you have any questions about it, please read the [MultiDex Scheme](http://docs.upltv.com/docs/show/78 "Fix up 65535").
